\title{Probability of a single transition under neutral theory}
\usage{
xprob(m, n, Jt, ss = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{vector of relative abundances at start of transition.}

\item{n}{vector of relative abundances at end of transition.}

\item{Jt}{ratio of J (community size) to t (# generations).}

\item{ss}{vector of length 2 giving number of samples at times for m and n.}
}
\value{
loglik value.
}
\description{
Gives the probability of a single observed transition in community compositions
under Hubbell's neutral theory, for a given ratio of J (community size) to
t (# generations).
}
\details{
Used by xxprob. Sums of m and n must each be in the interval (0,1]. Allows
for incomplete sampling; if nothing is given for ss, assumes m and n represent
true relative abundances.
}
\examples{
xprob(m=c(0.1,0.1,0.8),n=c(0.2,0.3,0.5),Jt=10,ss=c(1000,1000))
