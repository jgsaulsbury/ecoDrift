#' Probability of a set of transitions under neutral theory with migration
#'
#' @description
#' Gives the likelihood of a community composition timeseries under Hubbell's
#' neutral theory for given values of J and m. Unlike its helper function xprobm,
#' xxprobm takes data in the form of the number of individuals observed in each
#' species, rather than relative abundances. Can take either a single dataset or
#' a list of them.
#'
#' @details
#' Assumes non-overlapping generations. Because the user supplies the ages of each
#' time slice, the function needs to be given a generation time to know how many
#' generations separate each adjacent pair of time slices. Default is 1 year.
#'
#' @param log10Jm a 2-length vector containing log10 J (community size) and log10 m
#' (migration rate).
#' @param occs matrix of the number of observations in each species at each time.
#' One column for each species, one row for each time slice. Time goes from oldest
#' at the bottom to youngest at the top.
#' @param ages vector containing the ages of each time slice, in years, from
#' oldest to youngest.
#' @param sampled boolean indicating whether occs represents a sampled
#' community (TRUE) or instead represents true species abundances (FALSE).
#' @param metacommunity relative abundances of each species in the metacommunity,
#' given in the same order as in occs. If none given, takes the average species
#' abundances across the timeseries as a guess.
#' @param generationtime time between generations, in years.
#'
#' @returns loglik value.
